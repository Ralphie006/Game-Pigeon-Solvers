### The Basics  
In Word Hunt, players are presented with a board of letter tiles. 
In order to earn points, players must connect adjacent tiles on the 
board to form English words. The longer the word, the more points 
the player earns. Whoever scores more points in 80 seconds wins.
### How to use
First, download this project. You can invoke the tool by running  
```
> python3 ai_runner.py --game=wordhunt
```
Once you do this, you will be prompted for which board layout to use. 
There are four options: 4x4 (default), 5x5, Donut, and Cross.

Next, you will be prompted about which display mode you would like to 
use: `Diagram Mode` (default), or `List Mode`. Typing `i` will give you 
more information about each of them. 
#### Diagram Mode
Diagram mode will display each word one at a time, along with a 
visual representation of the board which shows the user the path 
they should take to connect the letters. Longer words will be 
displayed first.

#### List Mode
List mode will display every possible word on the board ten words at a time, 
along with the index on the board at which the first letter is located.
Longer words will be displayed first. A diagram showing the location of the
tile indices will also be displayed.
