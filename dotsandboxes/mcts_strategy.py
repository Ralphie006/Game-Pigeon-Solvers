# Dots and Boxes AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search
from collections import defaultdict

wi / ni + c * sqrt(t) / ni


# wi = number of wins after the i-th move
# ni = number of simulations after the i-th move
# c = exploration parameter (theoretically equal to âˆš2)
# t = total number of simulations for the parent node

# EXPANSION:
# When it can no longer apply UCT to find the successor node,
# it expands the game tree by appending all possible states
# from the leaf node.

# SIMULATION:
# After Expansion, the algorithm picks a child node arbitrarily,
# and it simulates entire game from selected node until it
# reaches the resulting state of the game. If nodes are picked
# randomly during the play out, it is called light play out.
# You can also opt for heavy play out by writing quality
# heuristics or evaluation functions.
